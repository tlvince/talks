:::notes
* This is a talk about connectivity
* We're becoming more and more reliant on the internet
* We design and build with the assumption that the internet is always there
* In reality, it's not

* Severely limited hotline; 1 provider, usually engaged
* Data collection completely paper based
:::

# Design appropriately {data-background-image='/images/call-centre.jpg'}

:::notes
* Lack of stable internet and performant devices forces us to design within more constraints
:::

# Design for all {data-background-image='/images/call-center-surveillance.jpg'}

:::notes
* These users are not necessarily young millennials
* What learnings can we apply from developing for habitually connected people?

# Offline First {data-background-image='/images/offline-dino.gif' data-background-color='white'}

:::notes
* We can't keep building things with the mindset that the internet is always there
* Limited access to the internet forces us to think about designing for offline
* Lack of internet should not be considered an error
:::

# Offline can be seamless {data-background-image='/images/direct-delivery.jpg'}

:::notes
* Network connectivity is intermittent at best. Deal with it.
* Lack of connectivity should be considered just another state
* Our products/projects should just seamlessly work offline
* But we have to develop trust
  * Will my data still be saved offline?
  * Will my data still be secure?
  * Clear communication
:::

# {data-background-image='/images/man-with-tablet.jpg'}

:::notes
* Drivers out on the road for ages
* Gather data offline, seamlessly and opportunistically sync whenever possible
* Store offline, sync P2P

* It happens to everyone, all the time:
  * In the tube
  * Flights
  * In conferences where too many people are connected at once
* 4G is not as pervasive as you think
* Excellent blog post by Instagram Engineering
* Can upload, comment on, perform any actions as usual, but queued
* Access to the network is prioritised by task, importance to the user
