# 1. Designing for the next billion

## Background

* 90% of the UK is connected, but <20% in Sub-Saharan Africa
* The game is changing: lower costs, lower barriers, proliferation of cheap devices
* These people are coming online for the first time
* These users are not necessarily young millennials
* What learnings can we apply from developing for habitually connected people?

## Conjectures

* We can't keep building things with the mindset that the internet is always there
* Limited access to the internet forces us to think about designing for offline
* Lack of stable internet and performant devices forces us to design within more constraints
* Gives us the chance to rethink; back to first principles

## Case studies

### Field

* Design out in the field with users, not in board rooms

### HAT

* Break up long forms
* Big selectable elements, not long, fancy drop downs
* Why did we ever think animated form inputs were a good idea?

### VAN

* Build trust
* Communicate offline states
* Allow people to try things out; show clear undo steps

# 2. Offline can be seamless

## Background

* Lack of internet should not be considered an error
* It happens all the time to everyone:
  * In the tube
  * Flights
  * In conferences where too many people are connected at once
* 4G is not as pervasive as you think

## Conjectures

* Network connectivity is intermittent at best. Deal with it.
* Lack of internet should not be considered an error
* It should be considered just another state
* Our products/projects should just seamlessly work offline
* But we have to develop trust
  * Will my data still be saved offline?
  * Will my data still be secure?
  * Clear communication

## Case studies

### Ebola contact tracing

* Some of the remotest places imaginable
* Gather data offline, seamlessly and opportunistically sync whenever possible

### Instagram

* Can upload, comment on, perform any actions as usual, but queued
* Access to the network is prioritised by task, importance to the user

### Direct Delivery

* Drivers out on the road for ages
* Store offline, sync P2P

# 3. Offline first is a social movement

## Background

* How many times have you seen "â€œError Establishing A Database Connection" (Wordpress error)
  * Centralised, single point of failure
* People are becoming more de-sensitised to decentralised, distributed systems
  * Bitcoin, blockchain
* What happens when your favourite unicorn startup is bought or shut down?
  * Where does my data go? Can I still access it?

## Conjectures

* Offline first is an enabler
* It offers universal access to the internet regardless of how good your connection is
* Democratises data

## Case studies

### Nav

* Data mandated by government that it should be hosted in country
* Distributed system problem; decentralised data storage

### Forth

* Offline enables job creation

### Ebola call centre

* In-house data collection for performance
* Synced back to the mothership for analysis
