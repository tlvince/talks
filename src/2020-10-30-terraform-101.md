## Basics

- Infrastructure as ~~Code~~ Config
  - See [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) for "Code"
- multi provider
  - cloud-orientated, but not limited to
- declarative
- execution plans
- composeable resources
- parallel resource creation

::: notes

- terraform: build infrastructure. Build the restaurant's building plumbing
- ansible: configuration management. Write the menu
- docker/packer: supercede configuration management, immutable
- if you've ever had to use CloudFormation, composability is a God-send

:::

## Syntax

- Written in HashiCorp configuration language (HCL)
  - `.ini` like, supports comments
- resources, modules
  - everything's centred around managing resources

```hcl
<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}
```

## Resource example

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

## Lifecycle

- state file: map config to real resources
- refresh: reconcile state with reality
- plan: diff state against desired state
- apply: apply changes, update state

::: notes

- state: internal JSON representation, resolve metadata, IDs etc.
- best stored remotely (e.g. S3, but careful with locking)

:::

## Execution plan

- main differentiator
- integrates nicely with PRs
- easy to read diff
- approve before applying changes

## Plan example

```
Terraform v0.12.24
Configuring remote state backend...
Initializing Terraform configuration...
2020/03/25 17:12:54 [DEBUG] Using modified User-Agent: Terraform/0.12.24 TFC/d55ce1e9f0
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
aws_cloudwatch_log_group.example_log_group: Refreshing state... [id=/aws/lambda/example]

----------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place
  - remove

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_lambda_function.example will be created
  + resource "aws_lambda_function" "example" {
      + arn                            = (known after apply)
      + description                    = "My lambda"

  # aws_lambda_function.example_2 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "aws_lambda_function" "example_2" {
      ~ memory_size                    = 1024 -> 512

  # aws_lambda_function.example_3 will be removed
  - resource "aws_lambda_function" "example_3"
```

## Workspaces

- logical grouping of resources
- each workspace gets its own isolated state file
- use cases:
  - isolate environments (though account-level isolation better)
  - as a temporary infra copy (per Git branches)
  - same infra, different env variables
  - modularise larger workspaces to limit blast radius

::: notes

- ideally shouldn't be differences between envs anyway

:::

## Caveats\*

- providers are just (Go) wrappers over vendor APIs
- behaviour can be inconsistent with admin console
- interpolations are unknown until `apply`
- language limitations: `count` vs `if`, no `module` `count`, `depends_on`
- tests?! localstack can help
- not suitable for app code
- importing existing infra into Terraform is painful

\*as of v0.12

::: notes

- some AWS features released before API and/or provider
- API Gateway was a common source of frustration
  - deployment model (redeploy if child resources change) inconsistent with TF
  - lost API usage keys
  - deploy fails with custom domains
- before v0.12, everything was a string
- `plan`/`apply` churn
- `count = var.some_condition == true ? 1 : 0`
- app code:
  - unoptimised for large bundles (e.g. Lambda zips)
  - non-deterministic deployment package hashing
  - solution: decouple from tf run

:::

## Automation ideas

- `plan` output in PRs
- `terraform {fmt,validate}`
- `tflint`: provider-specific linting + house style
- interactive approval and `apply`

::: notes

- Jenkins `input`, Atlantis
